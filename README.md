# ML Supervised Learning (Classification Problem)
This ML project shows a model that classifies features into those that meet the target or not.


## Problem Statement

Given the data or medical information of various patients, can we predict whether the patient has heart disease or not.



## Data

**Source of data:** Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset



## What you should expect

The following steps were taken on the dataset to develop an ML model
* Data exploration to determine the influence of various features on the outcome or target feature
* Popular ML machines were imported into the notebook.
* The data sets were described with statistic charts including a correlation matrix
* Classification ML models were deployed including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier & SVM Classifier
* After the initial scoring, the models were scored and evaluated
* The model hyperparameters were tuned using the following measures by hand coding, using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV
* The model outputs were evaluated with an ROC curve, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, etc.
